It is suggested that you run Tomcat 8.5.70. It is also suggested that you create a new project. Copy and paste the Servlet files to the appropriate packages and build the application from scratch rather than simply cloning the repository. It appears Tomcat builds a web server and servlet containers with computer system specific parameters and copying the build files from another persons computer may cause networking issues.



The required files/packages for your new project are:

build.gradle  
java/com/revature/  
webapp/WEB_INF
